# EECS_268
Code for EECS 268 Lab, taken Fall 2016

Course description:
Â This course continues developing problem solving techniques by focusing on the imperative and object-oriented styles using Abstract Data Types. Basic data structures such as queues, stacks, trees, and graphs will be covered. Recursion. Basic notions of algorithmic efficiency and performance analysis in the context of sorting algorithms. Basic Object-Oriented techniques. An associated laboratory will develop projects reinforcing the lecture material. Three class periods and one laboratory period per week.
